                    <h2>About the Cesky terrier breed</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Cesky Terrier (also known as the Bohemian Terrier) is a relatively new breed of dog, developed in the early 20th century in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) by crossing the Scottish Terrier with the Sealyham Terrier. 
                        The goal was to create a hunting terrier that could work in small spaces and have a gentle temperament.
                        Today, they are mainly kept as companion dogs. <br><br>

                        Cesky Terriers are small, with a height of about 10–12 inches (25–30 cm) at the shoulder and a weight of 13–22 pounds (6–10 kg).
                        Cesky Terriers are known for being friendly, affectionate, and loyal. They tend to bond closely with their families and enjoy being involved in daily activities. 
                        Despite their small size, they are brave, sometimes even feisty, and can have a strong-willed character.<br><br>

                        The Cesky Terrier is also fairly active and enjoys regular exercise. Short to medium-length walks, playtime, and mental stimulation are important to keep them happy and healthy.
                        Regular brushing, along with professional grooming every couple of months, is required to keep their coat looking its best.<br><br>
